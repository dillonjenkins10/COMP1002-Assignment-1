            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>
                Hey you, black leather jeans /
                The one talkin' dirty in the limousine now /
                Who do you want your man to be? /
                I got your name written over my fantasy now /
                Smooth talk but it ain't enough /
                Yeah, your words gettin' muddy like a pickup truck /
                Now, the other girls here ain't the brightest sun /
                But one look in your eyes and I know I've won /
            </p>

            <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
            <p>
                Kiss me /
                Flick your cigarette then baby kiss me /
                Come on baby, won't you just tease me? /
                We're going forty, fifty-five, sixty /
                You're so shifty!
            </p>

            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>
                What you got I'm feelin' more (What you got, what you got) /
                What you got I'm feelin' more (Over here you'll know for sure) /
                Come give me a taste let's hit the floor /
                Your love is a drug and I'm at the door /
                A slap in the face it makes me want more /
                Now come on baby let's hit the floor
            </p>

            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>
                I can't do this anymore /
                Soft skin pretty face what you take me for? /
                Her green eyes shine like a flare /
                Her bag doesn't match but she doesn't care /
                Buckle up cause we're takin' flight /
                And beware of the devil cause you know she bites yeah /
                Crooked bones leave a dead man cursed /
                Now come on baby and do your worst
            </p>

            <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
            <p>
                Kiss me /
                Flick your cigarette then baby kiss me /
                Come on baby, won't you just please me? /
                We're going forty, fifty-five, sixty /
                You're so shifty!
            </p>

            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p>
                What you got I'm feelin' more (What you got, what you got) /
                What you got I'm feelin' more (What you got who's keepin' score) /
                Come give me a taste let's hit the floor /
                Your love is a drug and I'm at the door /
                A slap in the face it makes me want more /
                Now come on baby let's hit the floor
            </p>

                Come on baby, won't you just please me /
                We're going forty, fifty-five, sixty /
                You're so shifty

                What you got I'm feelin' more (What you got who's keepin' score) /
                Come give me a taste let's hit the floor /
                Your love is a drug and I'm at the door /
                A slap in the face it makes me want more /
                Now come on baby let's hit the floor

                Come on babe I'm outside your door /
                Got my eye on you and that's for sure /
                A slap in the face it makes me want more /
                Now come on baby let's hit the floor /
                What you got I'm feelin' more /
                Come on babe I'm outside your door (What you got what you got) /
                Her green eyes shine and I want more
